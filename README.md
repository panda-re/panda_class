# panda_class

Materials for PANDA classes.  These classes can be self-guided or
instructor guided.  Each contains a class "script" which is words,
sentences, instructions, sample output etc.  Don't just execute the
"cue" commands though! You will learn more if read all of what is
written and understand what the commands you execute do.

*NOTE*: Class materials such as qcows (virtual hard drives for
PANDA/qemu) and PANDA replays are bigger than the 100MB git file size
limit. And someone had trouble getting git-lfs to behave. So these
files are available here:

http://panda.re/secret/pc2022.zip

You should unzip that and put the `panda_class_materials` directory in
your home directory. If there are qcows and replays needed by your
class they are in there.

## Classes in this repo

`intro`: An introductory class of maybe 2-3 hours in which you try out
a bunch of plugins.  You should move the directory of
`intro/panda_class_materials` to your home directory and then start
following the [class script](https://github.com/panda-re/panda_class/blob/master/intro/panda_class_materials/docs/panda_class.md).

`advanced`: An advanced version is planned that will involve
programming.
